                        Over the past two years, physicians in our office have used the CryoPen System to treat hundreds of patients with verruca. These patient presentations ranged from a singular lesion to mosaic warts, both unilateral and bilateral.</p>

                        There are certain advantages with the CryoPen System. It enables me to provide a treatment plan to patients without the need for injections or postoperative wound care. In addition, patients can get the treated areas wet.</p>

                        In my practice, I have found cryosurgery using the CryoPen System to be an effective modality for the treatment of pedal verruca in the majority of cases. The treatment is simple, quick and effective.</p>

                        With the Cryopen, since little preparation is needed and no anesthesia is required, treatment time takes just a few minutes from start to finish. It's literally just "plug and play". </p>

                        I find that using the Cryopen is very safe with no significant complications-no scarring, burning, or stitches. Plus procedures are not painful, most patients only experience mild discomfort after treatment.</p>

                        The Cryopen is extremely effective for Removeing warts, sebborheic keratoses, and actinic keratoses, usually in 1 treatment. </p>

                        The Cryopen device is very affordable. And we find that insurance reimbursement is very positive, allowing for a quick return on investment.</p>

                        The Cryopen is so simple to use, there's no preparation needed. Plus it's great to be able to treat skin lesions without needing an assistant or creating a mess.</p>

                        I love the comfort of knowing that when treating my patients with the Cryopen they do not need to worry about blood loss, hematomas, or ugly scaring that can be associated with other techniques used to excise skin lesions.</p>

                        The Cryopen treats lesion quickly and effectively. In fact, most lesions can be effectively treated within 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

                        Cryopen allows me to treat my patients effectively and safely while increasing my revenue-often without having to file insurance resulting on immediate payment.</p>
